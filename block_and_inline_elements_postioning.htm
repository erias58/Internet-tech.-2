    <!-- Block elements create a paragraph and they force the upcoming elements to a new line 
     to force block elements to apear in inline use the "display inline property in css" -->
     <!-- Inline elements just consume a given space its like writing a sentece in the paragraph 
      to force the inline elements to apear as block elements use "displsy block property in the css". -->

      <!-- 
      all elements are positioned in the static position and they are not affected by top,botom, right and left.

      POSTION RELATIVE works like static but it allows changing the bottom, top, right and left.
    POSITION ABSOLUTE the element is removed from its original position 
      
    POSITION FIXED makes the elemet fixed and it doesn't move while your scrolling vertically.

    POSTION STICKY the element moves while scrolling but when it reaches the top, it doesnt continue 
    while scrolling it turns to static.

    Z-INDEX PROPERTY makes the div elements stacked to apear like cards ina stack and the higher
    the value the more visible the div is.
